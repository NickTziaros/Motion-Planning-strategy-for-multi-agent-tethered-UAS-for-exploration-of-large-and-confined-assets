[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:39 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmoveit_planning_scene.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "moveit_planning_scene", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "moveit_planning_scene" with any of the following names:

    moveit_planning_sceneConfig.cmake
    moveit_planning_scene-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "moveit_planning_scene" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
  or set "moveit_planning_scene_DIR" to a directory containing one of the
  above files.  If "moveit_planning_scene" provides a separate development
  package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
